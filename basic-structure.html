  <p>My coursework at Davidson College has led me to classes such as statistics and basic econometrics, where I learned how to be proficient using Excel. Additionally, my personal interest in finance guided me to join the Davidson Investment and Finance Association (DIFA) where the club manages ~$600,000 of the college’s endowment. I have learned about the equity in the market and helped pitch ideas to potential investors (the club). DIFA allows me to learn about the market and how it operates, and I’m looking forward to applying what I have learned to future experiences in the financial field.

  <p>As the attached resume suggests, my experience working as a server at Midtown Sundries requires me to be detail oriented with a high level of accuracy while working under pressure. I learned how to communicate and advise the customer based on their preferences for certain foods. I ensure accuracy when I enter the order into the computer system and talk to the chefs to verify that the food is cooked correctly. Additionally, I have maintained and built positive customer relationships with my job as a server and as a customer representative for Pony Parties by Janet, where I have worked since 2010.
